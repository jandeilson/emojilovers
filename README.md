# About EmojiLovers
EmojiLovers is a small prototype PWA about emojis, unusual dialogues between lovers and... that's it, I guess... The project was initially designed for me to have fun with my girlfriend, but we liked the idea so much that we decided it would be very interesting to call more people to join the game and have fun.

This is minimalist prototype, I did it to be able to practive some development knowledge. I like the idea of other people helping to grow the project, so if you want to help, feel free, it's a open source.

Hope you have fun!

## How it works
Basically you say your and your lover name, select emojis with personalized dialogues by my girlfriend and me, and share those emojis and their dialogues with your lover. You can also put your love's WhatsApp number and automatically share emoji witth dialogue formatted to sent to your lover. Cool huh?
